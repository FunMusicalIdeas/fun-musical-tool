# Musical Patterns - Lab

A place to submodule all the musical patterns to develop on them all together.

Uses the `@musical-patterns/playroom` to let you hear them.

If you'd like to provide a whitelist of patterns to work with in the lab, you can do so in `src/selectedPatterns.ts`.
This will override the pattern filter from the `@musical-patterns/registry` repo.
