# Musical Patterns - lab

A place to submodule all the musical patterns to develop on them all together.

Uses the playroom to let you hear them.

Uses the compiler for testing purposes (snapshotting patterns).

## development

```

make add PATTERN=my-new-pattern

make snapshot PATTERN=some-pattern

make snapshot PATTERN=ALL

make publish PATTERN=some-pattern

make publish PATTERN=ALL

make ship PATTERN=some-pattern MSG="some message"

make ship PATTERN=ALL MSG="some message"

make update PATTERN=some-pattern

make update PATTERN=ALL

```
